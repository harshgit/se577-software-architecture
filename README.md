# se577-software-architecture

Hello
My name is Harsh Vardhan Bolakani and I am currently part of the Drexel Masters program
This is the repository used for the course SE-577 as part of the course

Currently I am working as Engineer 5 with Comcast Business and am part of a central team that develops tools, solutions, and frameworks for other software teams within Comcast Business.

With this course (SE-577), I do want to learn about various software Architectural patters that I haven't got a chance to apply in my projects and I am sure that learning them can spur ideas that will help me improve my products and enable me to become a better software engineer

I do have good experience building software with Java and have also done few university level projects with Python

In my free time, I love to play my guitar and love listening to rock, jazz and blues
I am looking forward to learning and working with everyone in this course
